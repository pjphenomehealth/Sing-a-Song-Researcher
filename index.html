The dirt is collected into a dust bag or plastic bin. Vacuum cleaners come in many forms, including stick, handheld, upright, canister, and specialized shop vacuums that can handle both solids and liquids.\n\nAlthough vacuum cleaner and vacuum are neutral terms, in some countries (e.g., the UK and Ireland) hoover is used generically (and as a verb) after the Hoover Company, one of the earliest producers of the device. In parts of New Zealand it\'s sometimes called a lux. The term sweeper may also be used, though it can refer specifically to a carpet sweeper.\n\nThe first manual vacuum designs using bellows appeared in the 1860s; motorized versions followed at the turn of the 20th century, leading to rapid innovation during that decade.'}

Alternatives include two-piece clamping systems and spring-fastened binder clips. Their simplicity and versatility have made them ubiquitous in offices, schools, and creative projects.
